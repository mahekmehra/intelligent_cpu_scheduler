INTELLIGENT CPU SCHEDULER SIMULATOR 

Project Overview

This project is a simulator for CPU scheduling algorithms including First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin (RR), and Priority Scheduling. The simulator provides real-time visualization through Gantt charts and calculates key performance metrics like average waiting time and turnaround time.

Features

✅ Supports FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling

✅ Gantt Chart Visualization for process execution

✅ Displays Average Waiting Time & Turnaround Time

✅ User Input Support for processes with arrival time, burst time, and priority
